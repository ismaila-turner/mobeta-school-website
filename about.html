            The History Of Mobe-ta School.
        </h1>
<p>
    MOBE-TA NURSERY SCHOOL was founded by Edna Turner in 1980. It started as a small school with only 58 pupils by then. 
    Mobeta school was the only school in Dippakunda in the 1980s but in thoes some  parents were not familiar in education. 
    The school was purposely build for the poor to start school with little or no payment.
    As she was growing old, she handed the school to her son called Musa Javis Turner who took it as the proprietor.
    Edna died in 1997(May Her Sole Rest In Perfect pease), 
    that was when her son Musa Javis Turner took it as complete ownership.
    Musa took the school and transformed it to a big, wonderful and lovely school(from nursery one to four.).
    musa always wanted all the children in the communication
    to take part in education as he always said to the parent eduaction is the key 
    to become succesful in life.</p>
<p>
     Many parents agreed with him but some did not. Parents where hard to convice in the community because so of them did not have the opportuity  to go to school.
    As time goes on many agree with him. The school began to have more and more 
    kid comming . the school was getting bigger and bigger as time goes on
    and so many parents began to bring to kid to the school to aquire eduaction.
    As from today so many students are successfully in their feild of studies.
    unfortutely the sad news happened in september 2013 that was when Musa Turner died ( May His Sole Rest In Perfect Peace).
